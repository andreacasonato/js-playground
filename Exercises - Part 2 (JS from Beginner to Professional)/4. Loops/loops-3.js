// In this exercise we will use a for loop to create an array that holds objects. Starting with creating a blank array, the block of code within the loop will create an object that gets inserted into the array.
// Setup a blank array, myWork.
// Using a for loop, create a list of 10 objects, each of which is a numbered lesson (e.g. Lesson 1, Lesson 2, Lesson 3â€¦) with an alternating true/false status for every other item to indicate whether the class will be running this year. For example: name: 'Lesson 1', status: true
// You can specify the status by using a ternary operator that checks whether the modulo of the given lesson value is equal to zero and by setting up a Boolean value to alternate the values each iteration.
// Create a lesson using a temporary object variable, containing the name (lesson with the numeric value) and predefined status (which we set up in the previous step).
// Push the objects to the myWork array.
// Output the array to the console.
