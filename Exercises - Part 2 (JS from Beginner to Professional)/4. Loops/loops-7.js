// In this exercise, we will experiment with looping over objects and internal arrays.
// Create a simple object with three items in it.
// Using the for in loop, get the properties' names and values from the object and output them into the console.
// Create an array containing the same three items. Using either the for loop or the for in loop, output the values from the array into the console.
