// This exercise will demonstrate how to create a string with all the digits as it loops through them. We can also set a value to skip by adding a condition that will use continue, skipping the matching condition. A second option is to do the same exercise and use the break keyword.
// Set up a string variable to use as output.
// Select a number to skip, and set that number as a variable.
// Create a for loop that counts to 10.
// Add a condition to check if the value of the looped variable is equal to the number that should be skipped.
// If the number is to be skipped in the condition, continue to the next number.
// As you iterate through the values, append the new count value to the end of the main output variable.
// Output the main variable after the loop completes.
// Reuse the code, but change the continue to break and see the difference. It should now stop at the skip value.
