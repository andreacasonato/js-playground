// In this exercise, we will create a basic counter that will increase a dynamic variable by a consistent step value, up to an upper limit.
// Set the starting counter to 0.
// Create a variable, step, to increase your counter by.
// Add a do while loop, printing the counter to the console and incrementing it by the step amount each loop.
// Continue to loop until the counter is equal to 100 or more than 100.
