// In this project, you will create a math multiplication table using loops. You can do this using your own creativity or by following some of the following suggested steps:
// Set up a blank array to contain the final multiplication table.
// Set a value variable to specify how many values you want to multiply with one another and show the results for.
// Create an outer for loop to iterate through each row and a temp array to store the row values. Each row will be an array of cells that will be nested into the final table.
// Add an inner for loop for the column values, which will push the multiplied row and column values to the temp array.
// Add the temporary row data that contains the calculated solutions to the main array of the final table. The final result will add a row of values for the calculations.
