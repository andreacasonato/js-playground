// Write a script that asks the user for their birth year. 
// Calculate their current age. 
// Account for the month: if the current month is before their birth month, they haven't had their birthday yet this year, so subtract one from the age. 
// Log "You are [age] years old." 
// (Hint: Use new Date() to get the current year and month. getMonth() returns 0 for Jan, 11 for Dec).
