// Simulate a simple shopping cart. 
// You have bought 3 items costing $9.99, $5.45, and $12.99. 
// Calculate the total cost. 
// Then, imagine a $5 discount is applied. 
// Calculate the new total. 
// Finally, log a message formatted like a receipt using template literals, showing the original total, the discount, and the new total, all formatted to 2 decimal places (e.g., $28.43).
