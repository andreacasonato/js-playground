// In this exercise, we'll create a Magic 8-Ball random answer generator:
// Start by setting a variable that gets a random value assigned to it. The value is assigned by generating a random number 0-5, for 6 possible results. You can increase this number as you add more results.
// Create a prompt that can get a string value input from a user that you can repeat back in the final output.
// Create 6 responses using the switch statement, each assigned to a different value from the random number generator.
// Create a variable to hold the end response, which should be a sentence printed for the user. You can assign different string values for each case, assigning new values depending on the results from the random value.
// Output the user's original question, plus the randomly selected case response, to the console after the user enters their question.
